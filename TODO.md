# Parker AI Assistant - TODO List

This file outlines potential future tasks and improvements for the Parker AI Assistant project.

## General

- [ ] Implement a proper configuration file (e.g., using YAML or TOML) instead of relying solely on environment variables.
- [ ] Add logging for better debugging and monitoring.
- [ ] Improve error handling across all components.
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests.
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline.

## Backend (`final.py`, `parker_web/app.py`)

- [ ] Refactor `final.py` into smaller, more manageable modules (e.g., `ai_logic.py`, `weather.py`, `music.py`, `web_search.py`).
- [ ] Enhance session management, potentially using a database for persistence.
- [ ] Add support for multiple users.
- [ ] Implement more robust input validation.
- [ ] Explore asynchronous operations for better performance (e.g., using `asyncio`).
- [ ] Add more utility commands (e.g., setting reminders, calendar integration, news headlines).
- [ ] Improve the flexibility of command parsing.

## Frontend (`parker_web/static`, `parker_web/templates`)

- [ ] Improve the responsiveness and mobile usability of the web UI.
- [ ] Add visual feedback for ongoing actions (e.g., "Parker is thinking...", "Fetching weather...").
- [ ] Implement a more sophisticated voice visualization.
- [ ] Add a settings page for persistent user preferences.
- [ ] Explore using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) for the frontend.
- [ ] Add support for different languages.

## Voice Interaction

- [ ] Improve the accuracy and robustness of speech recognition.
- [ ] Allow users to customize the wake word.
- [ ] Add support for different Text-to-Speech engines or voices.
- [ ] Handle interruptions during speech synthesis.

## External Integrations

- [ ] Add more music service integrations.
- [ ] Integrate with other AI models for comparison or fallback.
- [ ] Explore integrations with other services (e.g., email, social media - with user consent and security in mind).

## Documentation

- [ ] Create detailed API documentation.
- [ ] Write a user guide.
- [ ] Document the setup and deployment process more thoroughly.
